  "summary": "Caching is a crucial concept in software development that enhances performance by storing copies of data in faster-access storage. This technique is applicable at both the client and server levels, where it significantly reduces latency and increases throughput. By leveraging caching, systems can minimize the need for repeated data retrieval from slower storage mediums like disk drives, thereby optimizing resource usage and improving user experience. Caching strategies can vary, including methods like write-through, write-back, and right-around caching, each with its own advantages and trade-offs depending on the application's requirements.",
