  "summary": "NoSQL, which stands for 'not only SQL', refers to a category of non-relational databases that provide flexible data storage options compared to traditional SQL databases. Unlike SQL databases that rely on structured schemas and relationships, NoSQL databases can handle various data types and structures, making them suitable for applications requiring scalability and rapid data access. The rise of NoSQL databases in the 2010s was largely driven by the need to overcome the limitations of SQL databases, particularly in terms of scalability and the ability to manage large volumes of data efficiently. NoSQL databases can be categorized into several types, including key-value stores, document stores, wide-column stores, and graph databases, each designed to address specific data storage and retrieval needs.",
