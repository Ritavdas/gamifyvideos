  "summary": "Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are systems designed to cache data closer to end users, reducing latency and improving the speed of data retrieval. By distributing servers globally, CDNs allow static content such as images, videos, and JavaScript files to be accessed from locations nearer to users, rather than relying solely on a central origin server. This not only enhances the user experience by speeding up access to content but also alleviates the load on the origin server, increasing overall system reliability and availability. CDNs can be categorized into push and pull types, each with distinct methods for managing how and when content is distributed across the network.",
