  "summary": "Message queues are a powerful tool for handling large volumes of application events that may be generated faster than they can be processed. By decoupling the event producers from the event consumers, message queues allow for asynchronous processing of events, which enhances scalability and reliability. Events are sent to a message queue where they are stored durably, ensuring that they are not lost even if the queue crashes. This architecture allows applications to process events at their own pace, rather than requiring immediate processing, which can lead to bottlenecks.",
