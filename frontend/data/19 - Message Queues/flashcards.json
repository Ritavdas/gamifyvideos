      "front": "Why use message queues?",

      "front": "What does it mean to process events asynchronously?",
      "back": "Processing events asynchronously means that events are handled at a later time rather than immediately, allowing for better resource management.",

      "front": "What is event decoupling?",

      "front": "What is the role of a message producer?",

      "front": "What is the difference between message queues and databases?",

      "front": "How do message queues help with scalability?",
