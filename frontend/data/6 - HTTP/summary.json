  "summary": "This transcript provides an overview of application layer protocols, focusing primarily on HTTP and WebSockets, which are crucial for developers, especially in system design interviews. It begins by explaining the client-server model, where clients (which can be users or other servers) make requests to servers that fulfill those requests. The concept of Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) is introduced, emphasizing that many application layer protocols, including HTTP, are essentially RPCs that allow code execution on remote machines. The discussion then transitions into the specifics of HTTP, detailing its request-response nature, the anatomy of HTTP requests and responses, and the various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) used for different operations.",
