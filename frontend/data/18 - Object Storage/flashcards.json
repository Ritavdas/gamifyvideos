      "front": "How does object storage differ from file systems?",

      "front": "Can files in object storage be updated after being stored?",

      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "front": "What is a key characteristic of how objects are stored in object storage?",
      "back": "Objects are stored with globally unique names, meaning no two objects can have the same name across all users of the service.",

    },
    {
      "front": "How does object storage optimize access to stored objects?",
      "back": "Object storage uses a flat structure similar to a hash map, allowing for quick access to objects through unique keys.",

      "front": "What is a common trade-off when using object storage?",

    },
    {
      "front": "What is the relationship between object storage and hash maps?",
      "back": "Both object storage and hash maps use unique keys for quick access and do not allow duplicate entries.",

      "difficulty": "hard"

    {
      "front": "What types of files are typically stored in object storage?",

    {
      "front": "What illusion do some object storage services create?",
      "back": "They create the illusion of a file system by allowing users to organize files into 'folders,' but these are just part of the file names.",

      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "front": "What is the significance of globally unique names in object storage?",
      "back": "Globally unique names prevent naming conflicts across different users and instances of the storage service.",

      "difficulty": "hard"

      "front": "What is the predecessor to object storage?",
