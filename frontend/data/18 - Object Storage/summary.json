  "summary": "Object storage has emerged as a significant storage solution over the past 10 to 15 years, providing a flat structure for data storage that differs from traditional file systems and databases. Unlike file systems that utilize a hierarchical structure with folders and subfolders, object storage organizes data in a flat manner where each object is identified by a unique key. This model is particularly efficient for storing large files such as media and backups, which are typically unsuitable for traditional databases due to their size and the nature of access. Popular object storage services include AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage, which offer an interface that mimics file systems but operates without true hierarchical organization.",
