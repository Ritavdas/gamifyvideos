    {
      "question": "Why are B plus trees preferred over binary trees in databases?",
      "options": [
        "They are easier to implement",
        "They can have multiple children per node",
        "They require less memory",
        "They are faster for all operations"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "B plus trees can have multiple children per node, which helps reduce the size of the tree and minimizes the number of read and write operations needed."

      "question": "What happens to data stored in RAM if the computer crashes?",
      "options": [
        "It is saved to disk",

        "It is backed up automatically",
        "It is sent to the cloud"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Data stored in RAM is volatile and will be lost if the computer crashes, unlike data stored on disk which is persistent."

      "question": "Relational databases store data in a structured format.",
      "correct_answer": true,
      "explanation": "Relational databases organize data in tables with defined relationships, making it structured and easy to query."

      "question": "B plus trees can only have two children per node.",
      "correct_answer": false,
      "explanation": "B plus trees can have multiple children per node, which is a key feature that differentiates them from binary trees."
    }
  ],
  "short_answer": [
    {
      "question": "Explain the significance of data persistence in relational databases.",
      "sample_answer": "Data persistence ensures that data is not lost when the computer crashes, as it is stored on disk rather than in volatile memory.",
