  "summary": "The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, is a fundamental principle in the field of distributed databases that outlines the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. It states that in the presence of a network partition, a distributed system can only guarantee two out of the three properties: consistency (C), availability (A), and partition tolerance (P). While many misunderstand the theorem as allowing for the selection of any two properties, the reality is that partition tolerance is a given in distributed systems, leaving designers to choose between consistency and availability. This theorem is particularly relevant for NoSQL databases, which often prioritize availability over strict consistency, especially in scenarios where network partitions may occur.\n\nThe confusion surrounding the CAP theorem often stems from the definitions of its key terms. Consistency refers to the guarantee that all reads will return the most recent write, while availability means that every non-failing node will respond to requests, regardless of whether the data is up-to-date. The discussion emphasizes that while many systems strive for a balance, the inherent nature of distributed systems makes it impossible to achieve all three properties simultaneously during a network partition. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial for database design and helps inform decisions based on specific application needs.",
