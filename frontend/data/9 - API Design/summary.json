  "summary": "API design is a critical aspect of software development that focuses on defining how users interact with an application through its interface. It encompasses various paradigms that dictate the structure and functionality of the API, often referred to as the API contract. The design process involves specifying endpoints for actions such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources\u2014commonly known as CRUD operations. A well-designed API should prioritize user experience, ensuring that changes do not disrupt existing functionality, which is achieved through practices like backward compatibility and versioning.",
